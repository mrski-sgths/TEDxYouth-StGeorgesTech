          <p>Fran lives in Wilmington, Delaware, and is a freshman at Ursuline Academy. She participates in Mental Health Advocacy and Spectrum at school; Queer Teens of Delaware outside of school; and regularly volunteers at Woodlawn Library and Faithful Friends Animal Shelter in her free time. At the age of ten, she learned that she was conceived with a sperm donor. Constantly interested by her “unknown” family, she began talking to some of her forty-five half-brothers and half-sisters as well as her biological father at the age of twelve. Fran has made close connections with many of her cryo-siblings since. She’s eager to share with TEDx fans and her Ursuline family her journey of learning about her conception and siblings and how it affected her personal life. She wants nontraditional families like hers to be normalized in today’s society.</p>
